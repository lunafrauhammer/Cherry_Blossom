# Cherry Blossom

This project contains my predictions for the 2023 Cherry Blossom Prediction Contest hosted by the George Mason University Department of Statistics. Goal of this contest was to use public data to predict the peak bloom date of cherry trees at three different locations (https://competition.statistics.gmu.edu/). 

The results of the power analyisis can be found on the corresponding github pages site: https://lunafrauhammer.github.io/cherry_blossom
